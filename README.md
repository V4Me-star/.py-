Python List Operations
This repository contains a simple Python script (list_operations.py) that demonstrates fundamental list manipulation techniques. The script follows a series of steps to create, modify, and query a list, showcasing key methods like append(), insert(), extend(), pop(), sort(), and index().

Script Overview
The script performs the following actions on a list named my_list:

Initial Creation: Creates an empty list.

Appending Elements: Adds the numbers 10, 20, 30, and 40 to the list.

Inserting an Element: Inserts the value 15 at the second position (index 1).

Extending the List: Appends another list [50, 60, 70] to the end.

Removing the Last Element: Deletes the last item from the list.

Sorting: Arranges the list's elements in ascending order.

Finding an Index: Locates and prints the index of the value 30.

How to Run the Script
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Clone this repository to your local machine:

Bash

git clone [your-repository-url]
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd [your-repository-name]
Execute the Python script from your terminal:

Bash

python list_operations.py
Expected Output
When you run the script, you should see output similar to the following, demonstrating the state of the list at each step:

After appending: [10, 20, 30, 40]
After inserting 15 at second position: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40]
After extending: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
After removing last element: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
After sorting: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
The index of value 30 is: 3
